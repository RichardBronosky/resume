% Congratulations! You are among the elite few who will ever see the source code
% that generated the resume PDF that most others stop at. Your curiosity in me
% makes me more interested in you. When we speak, be sure to mention that you
% saw this message. That said, let me make a disclaimer. The state of this code
% is very unpredictable. I customize my resume for every recipient I send it to.
% Most of the customizations get `git stash`-ed, `git branch`-ed, or `git
% rebase`-ed away. But, there is always a fair bit of tech-debt in this code. I
% like to believe that someday I will make this a gleaming example of what a
% resume template should be. But, I find the Docker container that I built for
% generating the PDF to be much more interesting to polish. Have you seen it?
% It's in this repo. Unlike this code, it's a great example of the work I do.
