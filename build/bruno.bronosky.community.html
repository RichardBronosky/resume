<h2>What I hope you take away from this</h2>

<p>
  I love technology and I feel grateful that I can make a living doing something
  that I gladly do for free/fun. I have received so much from the Open Source
  community that I am honored to be able to give back. I don&rsquo;t have the
  elitist developer mentality. I seek qualities in others and address them in a
  way to improve those qualities.

        Can be considered an example of my approach to coding standards. I
        don&rsquo;t feel it&rsquo;s productive to enumerate rigid rules for my
        teams (in most cases). I prefer we share an understanding about why some
        things are prone to error or misunderstanding and trust that I hired
        smart people who can choose when to improvise.

    <ul>
      <li>
        I selected <code>confd</code> as the preprocessor/templating solution
        for my team. I wanted them to all get familiar with it, but I felt like
        the extraneous information in the official documentation was distracting
        and made it hard to follow. I created an abridged version of the
        official guide by removing everything but the simplest
        [<code>file</code>] backend. I am a huge proponent of
        <strong>&ldquo;Copy-Pasta&rdquo;</strong> (yes, üçù) and always try to
        include demos that are ready to paste in a shell.
