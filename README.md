Principal DevOps Engineer — Rooms To Go

## This is my resume. There are many like it, but this one is mine.

I am a coder. I write code. I coded my [resume in LaTeX] because that is the way I want to maintain it. I have made it available in [PDF form][PDF resume] because it is reliable. Do not ask for it in "Word" format.

## Not really a Cover Letter

You can learn everything you need to know about me by looking at [what I put out into the Open Source community][community]

## This repo is special

There are many resumes on github. This repo is unique because it is also the source code for the popular [richardbronosky/latex-compiler] Docker image.
