# Bruno Bronosky

Principal DevOps Automation Engineer and Trainer

## [View Resume HTML][HTML resume] / [View Cover Letter (alternative)][MD cover letter]

--------

## This is my resume. There are many like it, but this one is mine.

I am a coder. I write code. I coded my *one-pager* [resume in LaTeX] and my *full* [resume in YAML]
because that is the way I want to maintain it. I have made it available in [PDF form]
because it is reliable. Do not ask for it in "Word" format.

## Not really a Cover Letter

You can learn everything you need to know about me by looking at
[what I put out into the Open Source community][MD cover letter]

## This repo is special

There are many resumes on github. This repo is unique because it is also the source code for the
popular [richardbronosky/latex-compiler] Docker image.
