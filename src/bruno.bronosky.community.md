# Community Involvement

## What I hope you take away from this

I love technology and I feel grateful that I can making a living do something that I gladly do for free/fun. I have received so much from the Open Source community that I am honored to be able to give back. I don't have the elitist developer mentality. I seek qualities in others and address them in a way to improve those qualities.

## StackOverflow answers

- [`aws` cli not added to path after installation](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/23332147/awscli-not-added-to-path-after-installation/42984351#42984351)
  - Shows how I don't just give people the answer they seek, but also encourage them to learn how to approach similar future issues.

- [How can I copy the output of a command directly into my clipboard?](https://gist.github.com/RichardBronosky/56d8f614fab2bacdd8b048fb58d0c0c7)
  - Shows how I follow the [Unix philosophy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_philosophy#Origin) even when writing a simple bash script.

- [How can I check if a string represents an int, without using try/except?](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1265665/how-can-i-check-if-a-string-represents-an-int-without-using-try-except/4894182#4894182)
  - An example of a "clever" solution to a problem and that I take responsibility for verifying my solutions before I contribute them.

- [How do I redirect output to a variable in shell?](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2559076/how-do-i-redirect-output-to-a-variable-in-shell/15170225#15170225)
  - Shows how I respectfully teach complex concepts.

- [How do I parse command line arguments in Bash?](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/192249/how-do-i-parse-command-line-arguments-in-bash/14203146#14203146)
  - Is my most popular answer and I refer back to it nearly every day because I write multiple new tools every single day.

- [Returning a boolean from a Bash function](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/5431909/returning-a-boolean-from-a-bash-function/43840545#43840545)
  - Can be considered an example of my approach to coding standards. I don't feel it's productive to enumerate rigid rules for my teams (in most cases). I prefer we share an understanding about why some things are prone to error or misunderstanding and trust that I hired smart people who can choose when to improvise.

- [Using the RUN instruction in a Dockerfile with 'source' does not work](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/20635472/using-the-run-instruction-in-a-dockerfile-with-source-does-not-work/45087082#45087082)
  - Is my explanation of not just how, but also why a common Docker problem/pattern should be avoided.

- [How to get my own IP address and save it to a variable in a shell script?](https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/8518/how-to-get-my-own-ip-address-and-save-it-to-a-variable-in-a-shell-script/402160#402160)
  - Is something I share a lot because there are lots of fragile/terrible ways that people approach this need.

- [How to sign in kubernetes dashboard?](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/46664104/how-to-sign-in-kubernetes-dashboard/47761914#47761914)
  - Shows why I love awk for oneliners (and vicariously why I say I like PowerShell's concept of passing objects instead of text streams).

- [How to convert string to integer in UNIX?](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/11268437/how-to-convert-string-to-integer-in-unix/59781257#59781257)
  - Is a good example of what I mean by "I love to code because it satisfies my curiousity. I'm lucky to get paid for doing something that I'd be doing for free otherwise."

- [Why does Vim ignore my modeline values?](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/4590191/why-does-vim-ignore-my-modeline-values/41994024#comment93649087_41994024)
  - Shows how I accept and celebrate correction.

## GitHub projects

- [Raspberry Pi Pre Init for Kubernetes](https://github.com/RichardBronosky/pi-init2/tree/kubernetes)
  - Is something I'm working on to support a curriculum for my Decatur Makers and some local schools. It uses my original Pi-Init (basically cloud-init for Raspberry Pi) to create a cluster with no human interaction.

- [Arduino On-Ramp](https://github.com/RichardBronosky/Arduino-On-Ramp-Class)
  - Is a class that I teach with Maureen Haley at Decatur Makers.

## Gist

- [Quick Start Guide for `confd`](https://gist.github.com/RichardBronosky/82dcea3f069667870b936d0391d12260#demo-script)
  - I selected `confd` as preprocessor/templating solution for my team. I wanted them to all get familiar with it, but I felt like the extraneous information in the official documentation was distracting and made it hard to follow. I created an abridged version of the official guide by removing everything but the simplest [`file`] backend. I am a huge proponent of **"Copy-Pasta"** (yes, üçù) and always try to include demos that are ready to paste in a shell.
