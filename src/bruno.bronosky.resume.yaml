  summary: |-
    Born in the Appalachian mountains of West Virginia to a radio electronics technician, Bruno grew up in coal mining
    country where most of his classmates remain. He never threw a ball with his father, though they did attend a
    handful of Cincinnati Reds baseball games. They spent their nights and weekends soldering Heathkit projects from
    Radio Shack and writing games and equation solvers in Borland Turbo Basic, then Turbo Pascal, and eventually Delphi.
    When calling his father in 1995 to tell him Bruno got his first professional programming gig, they both saw this
    like getting drafted into MLB. Every day Bruno feels like "the luckiest man in baseball" to have escaped the coal
    mines.
